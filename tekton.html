                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Breakout originated as an internship project intended to deepen my familiarity with the Godot engine. 
                    As development progressed, I extended the project to incorporate backend-oriented functionality aligned 
                    with my experience as a web developer. This involved implementing structured data management using JSON, 
                    designing and deploying a lightweight server, and establishing a communication layer between the Godot 
                    client and the backend service. Through these additions, I was able to prototype and evaluate backend 
                    workflows—such as request/response handling, data serialization, and state synchronization—within an 
                    interactive game environment.

            <h1>Core Gameplay</h1>
            <p>The project is a breakout game with some extra implementation that I added for my internship.The bricks 
                that can be broken need to havethe same color as the ball, which is something that I did using the 
                modulate od the bricks and ball and define when it will break using signals.There is a 'deathzone' 
                below that signifies when the user lost a life and when they lose3 lives the lose the game. This also 
                happened using signals where in the main-game loop I wrote the signal code and then activated it
                inside different scripts. The same I also did with the score using signals again. The next addition to
                the game was a dedicated server that stored in web the players score but also the user could write his name
                and save it as well together with the score. I did this to work both for web export but also the scores and
                names can be stored/saved locally on the computer of the user.

            <h1>What I Learned</h1>
            <p>
                During this project I learned a lot about different ways of communicating between scripts, that makes it more
                simple and readable for another programmer. It was my first time trying to set up a server and connect it with 
                the game engine to store some data and through this experience I learned a lot of important things. First, how 
                to make an HTTP request to the server, how to make the data that you want to send into a valid format which in
                this situation was JSON format and finally how to get it from the server, parse it and have it ready. This was
                also the first time that I created this connection using Rust and more specifically the Arctix-Web library that
                Rust provides. This project was something that made me realize how much enthusiasm I have for web developement 
                (even though i created a game) for both frontend and mostly on backend work and made me push more for the dream
                of becoming a full-stack developer. This was also one of the reasons that I got this internship because my supervisor
                is a senior fullstack Rust developer and through  him I took a glimpse of what o fullstack web developer does.
